# LDE â€“ Linked Data Engine

LDE is a suite of Node.js libraries to power your Linked Data applications and pipelines.
Use it to efficiently query, analyze, transform, enrich and validate RDF datasets.

LDE is built on standards including SPARQL, SHACL and DCAT-AP 3.0.

## Features

* Discover and retrieve datasets from DCAT-AP 3.0 registries.
* Query and transform datasets with pure SPARQL queries (instead of code or a DSL): no vendor lock-in.
* Use SPARQL endpoints directly when possible; import data dumps to a local endpoint when necessary.
* Compose pipelines with YAML (for non-technical users) or TypeScript code (for developers). 
* Get started quickly with ready-to-use Docker images.
